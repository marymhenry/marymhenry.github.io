      <div class="heading">An artist and designer at heart, Mary has spent the first part of her professional career teaching art to K-12 students, as well as working as a freelance graphic designer and photographer. She holds a B.A. in Studio Arts with a minor in Environmental Studies from St. Olaf College and a Masters in Education from the University of Minnesota. She is a lifelong learner, who enjoys learning new things and teaching others.

    Mary is a natural problem solver, curious how the world works and has a desire to figure out how to  make the best solution for everyone. She uses the design thinking method to help her solve problems.
    
    She is looking for clients who have an appreciation for the arts, nature and adventure.
